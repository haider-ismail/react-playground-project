## Hello world!
I'm Haider, a front-end developer residing in Birmingham, UK.

Welcome to my React playground, which I created to experiment with the latest React features. 

### Prerequisites
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

### Installation
If you don't already have yarn installed, install using the above link.

Install dependencies in the root of the project

`yarn`

Once dependancies are installed, run

`yarn start`

Runs on port :3000 (http://localhost:3000)

### TODO:



ENHANCEMENTS:
- Allow searching based on genre or different criteria 
- Make use of lazy loading 
- Random movie finder 
- Add a method to buy or rent the film from somewhere like Amazon 
- Add another theme 
- Allow the layout to change from grid view to row view 
- Optimise for ultimate performance 
- Anything else that you can think of!


### Examples of ReactJs features used in components:

#### Portals ([Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/portals.html))
-  `<Modal />` [Go to file](./src/components/Modal/Modal.tsx)


#### useEffect hook ([Docs](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#useeffect))
